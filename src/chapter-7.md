Natural language processing (NLP) is at the core of ChatGPT's ability to engage in natural language conversations with customers. As NLP technology advances, ChatGPT will become even more sophisticated in its ability to understand and respond to customers' inquiries and complaints. This will result in faster response times and improved accuracy.

### Voice-Activated ChatGPT
